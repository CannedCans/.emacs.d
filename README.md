# .emacs.d
My Emacs configuration, incredibly basic with a few packages installed

Note: If you choose to use this config on your own computer, you may have to jump through slight hoops to get the packages installed unless you are using Debian (where many of the packages are available on stable). If you are using Debian, run debian.sh as root and it will install the packages that I use.
